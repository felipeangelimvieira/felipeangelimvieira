### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a double-degree engineer, passionate about maths and programming. I believe maths and data can work together to create valuable products. 

Altought I've worked in some companies that didn't open-source their code, I've published some code on github that may be useful to you. For example,

- âš¡ [Shared Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/felipeangelimvieira/SharedNearestNeighbors), a clustering algorithm that works well in high-dimensional problems, with groups of different density and size.
- âš¡ [Rotation Net with TensorflowHub (v1)](https://github.com/felipeangelimvieira/RotationNet-Hub), the implementation of the state-of-the-art for 3D object classification with tensorflow hub.
- âš¡ [Remark Bibliography pluging](https://github.com/felipeangelimvieira/remark-bibliography-html), a remark plugin that transforms bibtex entry into a html list and citations into anchor tags.

I'm also creating a blog to explain ML methods in an intuitive manner: https://felipeangelim.com/blog. Soon to come a blog post about interesting interpretations of the Lasso and Ridge.
